### Sass Vs. Css: Generating css files

We're not using css directly in this app. All styles are being defined
in the `sass` language. So, before running the app, you have to compile
the sass files, use the following:

    $ compass compile static

If you aim to help the project sending patches, maybe it would be good
to start a watcher that will compile sass files when they change. To do
it, use it:

    $ compass watch static

## Actually running the app

Currently, you just have to issue:

    $ python manage.py syncdb
    $ python manage.py runserve 0.0.0.0:port
